## Question 1

### How does student attendance across Connecticut get affected by different factors that affect students? 

### Importance:
This question is interesting because it allows us to understand which factors have the biggest impact on student attendance in different districts across Connecticut. Influencing bodies such as the government will be able to use this data in order to better inform their decisions on what to focus on. For example, if you see the attendance for English learners is low, the schooling system should improve their existing programs to incentivise students to better participate in classroom activities that help them learn better. Furthermore, students facing homelessness having a low attendance rate could imply that they have extenuating circumstances that prevent them from coming to school. This information could be used for many reasons, such as offering courses at night to accommodate schedules and helping other government programs better assist these individuals.

### Analysis
The graph illustrates the attendance rates of Students in Connecticut by different student groups. These groups include ethnic groups as well as circumstantial groups such as students with disabilities or students experiencing homelessness. In this visualization, we looked at the attendance rates for the 2021-2022 school year, and results for most of the groups are fairly similar. The median attendance rate for all students was 93%, however the main outlier to this fact is students experiencing homelessness. The median attendance rate for students with homelessness was 83%, 10 percentage points lower than the median for all students. This information is useful to know because it suggests the main problems that this student group may struggle with, such as working a job during school hours, not having transportation to arrive at school, or other factors out of school. Knowing this information can help the school board create new programs to help these students get to school, as well as share information with other government programs that can assist these students. Another thing to highlight, students with high needs have a 2.3% difference in attendance rate on average compared to students without high needs. This could be explained by various factors, such lack of school staffing, poor staff performance, etc. In the future, the schools should try and better prepare their teachers to better accommodate students with higher needs to improve their experience
