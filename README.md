## Question 1

### How does student attendance across Connecticut get affected by different factors that affect students? 

### Importance:
This question is interesting because it allows us to understand which factors have the biggest impact on student attendance in different districts across Connecticut. Influencing bodies such as the government will be able to use this data in order to better inform their decisions on what to focus on. For example, if you see the attendance for English learners is low, the schooling system should improve their existing programs to incentivise students to better participate in classroom activities that help them learn better. Furthermore, students facing homelessness having a low attendance rate could imply that they have extenuating circumstances that prevent them from coming to school. This information could be used for many reasons, such as offering courses at night to accommodate schedules and helping other government programs better assist these individuals.
